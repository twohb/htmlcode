<h2>XHTML Info</h2>
<p> XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) is a family of XML markup languages that mirror or extend versions of the widely used Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the language in which web pages are written.

<div id="overview">
<h2>XHTML Stuff</h2>
<p>While HTML (prior to HTML5) was defined as an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a very flexible markup language framework, XHTML is an application of XML, a more restrictive subset of SGML. Because XHTML documents need to be well-formed, they can be parsed using standard XML parsersâ€”unlike HTML, which requires a lenient HTML-specific parser.</p>

<h2>XHTML History</h2>
<a name="History">XHTML 1.0 became a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation on January 26, 2000. XHTML 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on May 31, 2001. The standard known as XHTML5 is currently developed as XML serialization of HTML5 spec.<a/>
